                        <p>Starting from birth, babies come into contact with millions of germs every day. It is estimated that the human body contains enough white blood cells to cope with thousands of vaccines at any one time. If a child was given 11 vaccines at once, it would only use about a thousandth of the immune system. It is not a good idea to delay vaccinations to ‘spread the load’, because it leaves the child unprotected against serious diseases for longer.</p>

                        <p class="title">Why vaccinate?</p>
                        <p>Herd immunity will not definitely protect anyone who is not vaccinated. There are low vaccination rates in some parts of the UK and in some communities. This means that if your child is not vaccinated, it is quite likely that many of the people they come into contact with will not be vaccinated either. So if one person gets an infectious disease, it can spread quickly through all the unvaccinated people in the group (this happened during the 2013 measles outbreak in Wales).
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        For herd immunity to work properly, most people in the population need to be vaccinated. The exact rate depends on the disease; in the case of measles, 19 out of 20 people need to be vaccinated to protect the population. When measles vaccination levels drop below this level, outbreaks and epidemics become more common. So if you decide not to vaccinate because you think that herd immunity will protect you, you are making it less likely that you will be protected.
                        Herd immunity does not protect against all diseases. The best example of this is tetanus, which is caught from bacteria in the environment, not from other people who have the disease. It doesn’t matter how many people around you are vaccinated against tetanus – it will not protect you as an individual.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                                Healthy children in wealthy countries are still at risk from conditions such as meningitis and septicaemia (severe blood poisoning). There is also strong evidence that healthy, non-immunised children are more affected than adults during outbreaks of infectious disease because they have wider social networks and come into close contact with more people. There is no evidence that an organic diet offers any greater protection
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                                During any infection by bacteria or viruses, our immune system makes antibodies to fight that particular disease. For many diseases, an 'immune memory' is then created in special white blood cells called T lymphocytes. If we come into contact with the same disease, these white blood cells will 'remember' it and react quickly to fight it, so that we do not become ill. However, this process can only protect you against the specific disease that you have had. It does not make it easier for the body to respond to other kinds of infections.
